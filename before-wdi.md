# Important!
**Please complete the following steps as soon as possible.** We can't make classroom/squad assignments until you do!
- **Click [this link](https://garnet.wdidc.org/github/authorize?invite_code=22e5845c671634492c3a9dbeb7a21e90).** This will authorize you for Garnet, an application that both instructors and students will use to track your progress throughout WDI.  
- **Update your GitHub profile with your full name and profile picture.** The latter is very important - we need to know what you look like! The clearer the picture, the better.
- **Take the [start of class survey](https://outcomes.generalassemb.ly/courses/14107/surveys/background/new).** This allows us to collect emergency contact and food allergy information.
- **Complete the [outcomes prework](https://generalassemblydc.typeform.com/to/rOEItv).** This will take you 30 minutes - 1 hour.

Once you're done, we encourage you to take a look through [this readme](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi9/blob/master/README.md) if you would like to learn more about what you can expect out of WDI.

See you all Monday!
